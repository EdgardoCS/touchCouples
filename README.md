As intimate touch is more prevalent and natural, many efforts have investigated social touch in close relationships, especially romantic couples (Xu et al., 2023). Affectionate touch is associated with greater relationship satisfaction and individual well-being (Campbell et al., 2025; Jakubiak, 2022). In romantic partnerships, affective touch serves as a crucial medium for expressing love, affection, and emotional support. Behaviors such as hugging, caressing, and gentle stroking are common manifestations of this touch, reinforcing emotional bonds and enhancing relationship satisfaction (Sorokowska et al., 2021).
To explore touch dynamics in couples, we analyzed data from 7,115 dyads in the German Family Demography Panel Study (FReDA), where participants reported on the frequency and desire for three forms of touch using illustrated questionnaires (kiss, embracing, and intimate hugging), from which we calculated touch frequency, touch desire, and touch deprivation (defined as the discrepancy between desire and frequency). 
Touch-related responses were collected alongside five broader data categories: sociodemographic, personality and attitudes, well-being, formal relationship characteristics, and relationship quality.
Our findings reveal a positive correlation between both received and desired touch frequency and relationship satisfaction. Touch frequency was also associated with higher relationship communication quality for both Anchor and Partner. Notably, a negative correlation can be observed between touch frequency and relationship duration, which appears to be influenced by participant age.
These results emphasize the critical role of affectionate touch in maintaining relationship health and underscore the importance of considering both partners’ touch experiences in relationship research.
